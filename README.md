Random Slides: an improv party game
===================================

[Launch https://slide-roulette.glitch.me/](https://slide-roulette.glitch.me/)

This site generates a random talk title (using a Markov chain trained on TED talk titles), then pulls random slides with images from Flickr

The aim of the game is to give a talk, as fluently as possible... without knowing what it will be about in advance!

Press space, right arrow, enter, or click to advance slides, or reload to get a new title

You can navigate back with the left arrow, or see all slides generated so far by pressing escape

Does not guarantee images will be SFW or have appropriate usage rights (depends on Flickr API)

Uses markovify, names, Flickr API, reveal.js
